# What I usually install on a fresh box

* Using `apt`:

```
autokey-gtk
build-essential
dropbox
nvidia-352
nvidia-settings
software-properties-common
unattended-upgrades
vlc
```

* Using `linuxbrew`:

Assuming that `stow` already ran and linked the `Brewfile`:

```bash
cd
brew bundle
```

Using other means:

* https://launchpad.net/diodon
* Slack (google how to get it; snap seems to work fine)

# Additional settings

* [smyck-colors](https://github.com/vcavallo/gnome-terminal-colors-smyck)
